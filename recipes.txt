PORK CHOPS OR STEAKS:
3 pounds pork shoulder steak, 5-6 steaks
▢24 ounces light beer
▢8 ounces sweet barbecue sauce
For the spice rub:
▢3 tablespoons brown sugar
▢2 tablespoons smoked paprika
▢1 tablespoon onion powder
▢1 tablespoon garlic powder
▢1 teaspoon chili powder
▢1 teaspoon salt
▢1/2 teaspoon black pepper
For optional basting liquid:
▢8 ounces light beer
▢8 ounces apple juice
Instructions
 
Cover pork shoulder steak in light beer and marinate for a minimum of one hour, up to overnight.
Prepare a grill (check the two cook options below to choose your temperature).
Remove the pork shoulder steaks from the beer, then dry with a paper towel.
In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder, chili powder, salt and pepper.
Press the spice rub into the pork steaks, coating evenly on both sides. Allow to rest at room temperature. 
If you'd like to baste the pork steaks while they're grilling, combine the beer and apple juice in a small bowl.
QUICK OPTION: Grill on a covered grill over medium-high heat for 12 minutes per side, basting occasionally with the optional basting liquid.
PREFERRED OPTION: LOW AND SLOW: Grill on a covered grill over low-medium heat (or indirect heat on high) for 20-25 minutes per side, basting occasionally with optional basting liquid.
To finish the pork steaks, grill for an additional 3-4 minutes per side over direct heat, brushing generously with barbecue sauce on each side of the pork steak.
Transfer to a platter or cutting board and allow to rest for 5 minutes before serving.
Serve warm with additional barbecue sauce, if desired.

Notes
Use your favorite barbecue sauce, but I recommend looking for a sweeter sauce that is high in brown sugar or molasses (check the ingredient list). This will help you get an absolutely delicious, caramelized crust on the pork steaks! Please don't skip basting the pork steaks with barbecue sauce during the last 5 minutes of grilling, It's a game changer!
If you don't like sweet barbecue, reduce the brown sugar in the rub, and use a savory BBQ sauce!
